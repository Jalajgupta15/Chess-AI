# Chess AI

The **Chess AI** project implements a simple chess algorithm utilizing alpha-beta pruning and board evaluation with piece-square tables. This web-based application allows users to play chess against an AI that evaluates positions and selects optimal moves.

## Features

- **Chess Board Visualization**: Interactive chess board to display the game.
- **AI Move Calculation**: Uses alpha-beta pruning to determine the best move.
- **Search Depth**: Adjust the search depth for the AIâ€™s decision-making process.
- **Move History**: Keeps track of previous moves for review.
